# Fractions Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS)

This project is an **Ontology-Based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS)** designed to help learners understand **fractions** through structured exercises, adaptive feedback, and semantic reasoning.

The system uses an **OWL ontology** to represent domain knowledge and is implemented using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and **HTML** for the user interface.
